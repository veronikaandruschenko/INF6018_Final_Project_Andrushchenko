# INF6018 Final Project – Sentiment Analysis of Lithuanian News on School Examinations

This repository contains the final project for the course **INF6018 – Social Media Analytics**.  
The project provides methodological insights into sentiment analysis and applies a lexicon-based approach to Lithuanian news articles published by *Delfi.lt* (2020–2025), with focus on reporting about national examinations.

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to advance methodological understanding of sentiment analysis in media studies by integrating bibliometric mapping, comparative evaluation of analytical approaches, and empirical application to Lithuanian news coverage of school examinations. 
The analysis includes dataset construction, data cleaning, sentiment scoring, visualisation, and interpretation of findings.

## Methods Used

- **Data collection**: Web Scraper Chrome extension  
- **Programming language**: Python (pandas, matplotlib, wordcloud)  
- **Sentiment analysis**: VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)  
- **Comparative evaluation**: QCA across five conditions (accuracy, scalability, data need, adaptability, interpretability)  
- **Visualisation**: Bar charts, line plots, histograms, boxplots, word clouds

## Main Findings

- Lithuanian examination news is mostly **neutral** (≈64%).  
- Negative reporting peaks during reform debates in **2020–2022**.  
- Positive news is rare and usually highlights student achievements.  
- Lexicon-based models work reasonably well but lack Lithuanian domain lexicons.  
- Transformer-based models would likely perform better, but require annotated corpora.
